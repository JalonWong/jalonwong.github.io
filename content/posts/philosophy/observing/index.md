A person cannot fully focus on both doing something and observing themselves simultaneously because both actions require full mental effort, and we only have one brain. At best, one can reflect afterward, but by then, much information has already been lost, which limits the effectiveness. This is one reason why even studying psychology doesnâ€™t guarantee self-help. Therefore, improving daily behaviors requires good partners, and for psychological issues, one should seek a therapist.
